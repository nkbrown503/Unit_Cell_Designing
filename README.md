# Design Mechanical Metamaterial Unit Cells with Deep Reinforcement Learning

To train or test the RL agent, run the RL_UC_Designer.py files within the RL_Env folder.

The weight of the agents are currently being saved in the weights_48 folder in the RL_Env folder, but can be changed by changing the directory name in the networks.py file in the RL_Env folder. The save names for the actor and critic networks can be changes in the DDPG.py file in the RL_Env folder.
